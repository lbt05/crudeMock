Good quality <strong>dog and puppy foods</strong> are precisely balanced to ensure they meet all of your dog's nutritional needs and are packed with extra beneficial nutrients like omega fatty acids, antioxidants and prebiotic fibres.</p>\n\n<h2>Feed wet and dry dog food for optimal health</h2>\n<p>Mixed feeding, or feeding both <a href='https://www.petcircle.com.au/dog/food/dry-food'>dry dog food</a> and <a href='https://www.petcircle.com.au/dog/food/wet-food'>wet dog food</a> allows you to combine the convenience and economy of bulk bags of dry food with the variety and added health benefits of canned or pouch format recipes.
